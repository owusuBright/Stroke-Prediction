# Stroke Prediction
This project uses machine learning models, such as logistic regression and random forest to predict the likelihood of stroke based on health factors, using Python. Stroke is a medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted, causing brain damage and disability. The risk of stroke can be influenced by various factors, such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking, and obesity.

# Data
The data used in this project are from the Kaggle Stroke Prediction Dataset, which contains information about 5110 patients and their stroke status. The data are stored in a CSV file, with the following columns:

id: The unique ID of the patient

gender: The gender of the patient (Male, Female, or Other)

age: The age of the patient

hypertension: Whether the patient has hypertension or not (0 or 1)

heart_disease: Whether the patient has heart disease or not
 
ever_married: The marital status of the patient      

work_type: The type of work the patient does        

Residence_type: The type of residence of the patient (Urban or Rural)  

avg_glucose_level: The average glucose level of the patient

smoking_status: Whether the patient smoke or not or have any smoke history    

# Tools
The tools used in this project is Python, a popular tool for data analysis and machine learning. Python is used to perform data manipulation, preprocessing, and modeling, using libraries such as pandas, numpy,and sklearn. It is also used to create charts that display the results of the machine learning models and the importance of the features.

# Results
The results of this project are displayed in various plots and tables, showing the performance and accuracy of different machine learning models, such as logistic regression and random forest, in predicting the likelihood of stroke based on health factors. The results also show the confusion matrix and precision-recall curve for each model, as well as the feature importance ranking. The results can help to identify the risk factors and the preventive measures for stroke.
